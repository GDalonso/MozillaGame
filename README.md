# MozillaGame
Remix from a Mozilla Thimble example, with content designed to help Brazilian Math students to memorize key concepts and exercise what they learned everytime, everywhere, instead of only in quiet and designed for study places.
It's a auxiliar learning tool for exercises in a more fun way.
